## SharePoint Online VS SharePoint Server

SharePoint Online is a hosted solution that you can get by itself or with a Microsoft 365 subscription. SharePoint Server is an on-premises solution.




## Classic Sites vs Modern Sites


| Classic Sites | Modern Sites |
| --- | --- |
| ![Classic Site](https://www.rramoscabral.com/training/assets/MSSharePoint/ClassicSite.png) | ![Modern Site](https://www.rramoscabral.com/training/assets/MSSharePoint/ModernSite.png) 
| Great for people already working with SharePoint locally or online | Great for people who have never worked with SharePoint Online |
| Uses a classic environment | Uses a modern environment |
| Inlcude all the web parts from SharePoint | Inlcude: <br/> - Libraries<br/> - Pages<br/> - Site Contents | 


There are not many differences between the classic site and the Modern site although the homepage, term definition and libraries are different.

The default SharePoint modern site is currently set but Microsoft 365 administrators are still able to create a SharePoint classic site but the result will be half of the features are in classic site and the rest in modem site. Which means it's kind of a mixture of both and it can be extremely challenging.
