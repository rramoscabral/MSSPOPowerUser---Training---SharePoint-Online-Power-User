Organizations usually have an Intranet, which is an internal site that contains digital services, documentation, and organization tools for better internal communication. To access externally, an Extranet is used, which provides secure and controlled access to the organization's Intranet. 

One of the tools available to create these sites is through SharePoint. This makes it possible to create, share, organize, and discover information inside and outsidethe company.

## SharePoint Online VS SharePoint on-premises VS  SharePoint Hybrid

Organizations can choose to have the SharePoint environment in a variety of ways such as on-premises, online or hybrid.
- SharePoint Online is a hosted solution that you can get by itself or with a Microsoft 365 subscription. 
- SharePoint Server (on-premises) is an on-premises solution.
- SharePoint Hybrid is enables users in SharePoint on-premises to take advantage of SharePoint Online functionality.

## What is SharePoint Site

## Classic Sites vs Modern Sites


| Classic Sites | Modern Sites |
| --- | --- |
| ![Classic Site](https://www.rramoscabral.com/training/assets/MSSharePoint/ClassicSite.png) | ![Modern Site](https://www.rramoscabral.com/training/assets/MSSharePoint/ModernSite.png) 
| Great for people already working with SharePoint locally or online | Great for people who have never worked with SharePoint Online |
| Uses a classic environment | Uses a modern environment |
| Inlcude all the web parts from SharePoint | Inlcude: <br/> - Libraries<br/> - Pages<br/> - Site Contents | 


There are not many differences between the classic site and the Modern site although the homepage, term definition and libraries are different.

The default SharePoint modern site is currently set but Microsoft 365 administrators are still able to create a SharePoint classic site but the result will be half of the features are in classic site and the rest in modem site. Which means it's kind of a mixture of both and it can be extremely challenging.

You can see site activities, get quick access to recent and popular files, and view and edit lists on your team sites.

SharePoint mobile App is available on the following platforms:
