## Number of OneDrive accounts

There are limits to the number of accounts that can be concurrently signed in and syncing. 
- Each device is allowed a maximum of one OneDrive for home account and nine OneDrive for work or school accounts. 
- For MacOS devices, only a single business account from the same organization can be in sync at any given time. 


## OneDrive Guest accounts

Synchronizing content using an external or guest user is currently not supported by OneDrive.



## Network or mapped drives

You can't add a network or mapped drive as your OneDrive sync location. OneDrive doesn't support syncing using symbolic links or junction points.
