# OneDrive Upload and Share files

OneDrive gives you one place to store, share, and sync your work or school files.

As part of your organization's Microsoft 365 subscription, or SharePoint Server, you can save your files in OneDrive and then work with them from almost any device.


With your work or school account, so you can:
- Upload files from your PC or Mac.
- Share files with others.
- Give others permission to edit files and work on them at the same time.
- Get to your files from anywhere, on your computer, tablet, or phone.
- Sync OneDrive to your PC or Mac, so you can access your files even when you're offline.

<a id="share-files" />

<br/>

## Share files

The files on your OneDrive are private until you share them. Keep in mind that when you share folders with Edit permissions, people you share with can add the shared folders to their own OneDrive. This lets them keep the folder alongside their own folders and items, easily move items between folders, and more easily work on it offline. Any updates they make sync with the shared folder, so everyone with access to the folder is up to date.


**Share a file or folder**

When you share files and folders, you can decide whether to let people edit or just view them. You can see who a SharePoint file is shared with, and stop sharing SharePoint files or folders, or change permissions, at any time.


1. With a file open or a file or folder selected, select **Share**.
1. If you are working on your desktop and the file hasn’t been saved to OneDrive or SharePoint, select a location you want to upload your file.
1. Select the down arrow to choose permissions for the link you will be sharing. Options include:
    - **Anyone** (if your organization allows it)
    - **People in your organization**
    - **Share with specific people** - Choose this option if you want to send an email invitation to people or groups and keep track of who you invited. This also lets you remove permission for specific individuals or groups later if you need to.
    - **Share by using "Copy link"** - Choose this option to share items with lots of people you might not even know personally. For example, you can use these links to post to Facebook, Twitter, or LinkedIn, or share in an email or message. Anyone who gets the link can view or edit the item, depending on the permission you set. Users with the link cannot upload new items. Keep in mind that the link can also be forwarded and sign-in is not required.

1. Select **Apply** to save the permissions.
1. Enter the name or email address of people you want to share with.
1. Type a message.
1. Select **Send** or, you can select Copy Link and send the link in an email or add it to a file.

<br/>


**External sharing**

Global admins and SharePoint set the sharing level for SharePoint and OneDrive. The default level for both is "Anyone."

![External Sharing](https://www.rramoscabral.com/training/assets/MSSharePoint/ExternalSharing.png)


| Option | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Anyone | Allow users to share files and folders by using links that let anyone who has the link access the files or folders without authenticating. This setting also allows users to share sites with new and existing guests who authenticate. If you select this setting, you can restrict the Anyone links so that they must expire within a specific number of days, or so that they can give only View permission.|
|
|New and existing guests | Require people who have received invitations to sign in with their work or school account (if their organization uses Microsoft 365) or a Microsoft account, or to provide a code to verify their identity. Users can share with guests already in your organization's directory, and they can send invitations to people who will be added to the directory if they sign in.|
| Existing guests | Allow sharing only with guests who are already in your directory. These guests may exist in your directory because they previously accepted sharing invitations or because they were manually added, such as through Azure B2B collaboration. |
| Only people in your organization | Turn off external sharing. |
