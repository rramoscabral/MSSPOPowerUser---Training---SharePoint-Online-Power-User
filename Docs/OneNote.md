## Move a OneNote notebook to OneDrive

If you plan on sharing a OneNote notebook, either with yourself across your devices or with other people, it’s best to create it on OneDrive right from the start.

To move a notebook to OneDrive if you originally created the notebook on your computer, do the following:

1. In the OneNote desktop app, open the notebook that you want to share on OneDrive.

1. Select **File** > **Share**.

1. Select a location for your notebook, or select **Add a Place**, and then sign into your OneDrive account. If you don’t already have one, you can sign up for free.

1. Enter a name for your notebook (if you like, you can keep the name it already has), and then select **Move Notebook**.

1. After you see the location in the list, select it.

OneNote moves the notebook from your computer to OneDrive, and confirms the move with the message: “Your notebook is now syncing to the new location.”

After you’ve successfully moved a notebook to OneDrive, to share it with others, select **File** > **Share** > **Share with People**. This lets you send an email message with a link to your shared notebook to the people you select.

Depending on the notebook permissions you’ve set on OneDrive, recipients will be able to either view or modify your notes at the shared location.

## OneNote notebooks 

OneNote notebooks have their own sync mechanism outside of OneDrive. If you plan on sharing a OneNote notebook—with yourself or others—it's best to create it on OneDrive right from the start. Moving an existing OneNote notebook into a folder synced by OneDrive without going through the OneNote application is not currently supported.

Once a OneNote notebook is saved in OneDrive, if you are syncing the folder that contains the notebook, you will find a stub .url file, which will open the notebook on the website.

OneNote notebooks saved in OneDrive or SharePoint are limited to 2GB.

## Change permissions for a notebook on OneDrive
If you have a shared notebook on OneDrive, you can change the permissions for who can view or edit it.

1. Choose **File** > **Share** > **Share with People**.
1. Under **Shared with**, right-click the person’s name you want to change permissions for, and choose an option.

Choose:
- **Can Edit**, if you’d like them to be able to make changes to the notebook.
- **Can View**, if you want them to only be able to open it.

> **Note:**  If you choose Remove User, that person won’t have any access to your notebook. If no one is listed in this section it’s because you’re not sharing the notebook with anyone.

## Disable a sharing link

If you shared your notebook using a link, you can stop that link from working so people can’t view or edit your notebook. After you disable the link, people who click it will get a message telling them that the link might have been deleted or expired, or they might not have permission to view it.

1. Click **File** > **Share** > **Get a Sharing Link**.
2. Next to the **View Link** or **Edit Link**, click **Disable Link**.

> **Note:** If you see a **Create Link** button and no link, you haven’t created a link to your notebook, or you’ve already disabled it.

Changing permissions is usually all that you need to do to control access to your notebooks, but if you want to, you can permanently delete a notebook from OneDrive. If you’d like to share your notes without having other people in your notebooks, you can export notes as a PDF or send a page in email.
