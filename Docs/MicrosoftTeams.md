## Microsoft Teams clients

**Browser client**
The browser client [https://teams.microsoft.com](ttps://teams.microsoft.com) is a full, functional client that can be used from a variety of browsers. The browser client supports Calling and Meetings by using webRTC, so there is no plug-in or download required to run Teams in a browser. The browser must be configured to allow third-party cookies.

<br/>

**Desktop clients**

The Teams desktop client is available as a standalone application and as part of Microsoft 365 Apps for enterprise for the following operating systems:
- 32-bit and 64-bit versions of Windows (8.1 or later)
- ARM64 for Windows 10 on ARM
- Windows Server (2012 R2 or later)
- macOS
- Linux (in .deb and .rpm formats)
- Chrome OS (For more information, see How to use Microsoft Office on a Chromebook)


Teams desktop client updates are released every two weeks after rigorous internal testing and validation through Microsoft Technology Adoption Program (TAP). The update usually takes place on a Tuesday. If a critical update is required, Teams will bypass this schedule and release the update as soon as it’s available.

The desktop client updates itself automatically. Teams checks for updates every few hours behind the scenes, downloads it, and then waits for the computer to be idle before silently installing the update.

<br/>

**Mobile clients**

The Teams mobile apps are available for Android and iOS, and are geared for on-the-go users participating in chat-based conversations and allow peer-to-peer audio calls. For mobile apps, go to the relevant mobile stores Google Play and the Apple App Store.

## What is a Team in Microsoft Team

It is a collection of people from the organization or guests, content and tools that involve different projects and outcomes within an organization.

A channel is a section dedicated to a team that keeps communication organized

The person in charge of the team is responsible for managing its content

When you create a team, here's what gets created:
- A new Microsoft 365 group
- A SharePoint Online site and document library to store team files
- An Exchange Online shared mailbox and calendar
- A OneNote notebook
- Ties into other Microsoft 365 and Office 365 apps such as Planner and Power BI

When you create a team from an existing group, that group's membership, site, mailbox, and notebook are surfaced in Teams. 


There are two types of teams
- Microsoft Teams 
- Microsoft Teams for Education
