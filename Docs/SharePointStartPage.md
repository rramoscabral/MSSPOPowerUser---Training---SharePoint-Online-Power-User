## Home Site

The home site it is the main site with the main purpose to act as the landing page. It brings together news, events, embedded video and conversations, and other resources to deliver an engaging experience that reflects your organization's voice, priorities, and brand.

You only need one home site to take advantage of home site features. Home sites do not replace communication or team sites, but instead provide a landing place for your organization. Think of home sites as an add-on to your intranet design. Home sites are SharePoint communication sites that have special capabilities such as being marked as an official source of news in the organization. Consider making your tenant's root site the home site. Next, review key differences between standard SharePoint communication sites and home sites.


![Share Point Start Page](https://www.rramoscabral.com/training/assets/MSSharePoint/ModernSite_small.png)

You can change the look and the home site will include the following option and modern web parts like:
- Search box
- Create a site
- Create a new post
- Following
- Recent
- Featured links
- News from sites
- Frequent sites
- Suggested sites
- Save for later


SharePoint administrator can set home site using the SharePoint admin center or by using PowerShell.

Examples of a SharePoint starter site
- Provide a gateway to other high-traffic portals
- Connect people with an intranet-wide search experience
- Showcase targeted news and content
- Take advantage of the new people engagement tool, Viva Connections



<br/>

**Best practices for creating home sites:**
- Because a home site is used by the entire organization, the site needs to be inclusive and easily accessible on all devices
- For the same reason above, consider other languages that might be needed
- The home site will be viewed by high volume of users. Make sure you manage site performance through the planning and building phases
- Links in the home site navigation can direct users to content on the home site and global navigation can be used to lead users to universally used resources and portals
- After creating your home site, replace the site with the current root site
- Make sure the home site is discoverable by adding an entry point to the Microsoft 365 app launcher and a featured link on the SharePoint start page
- News published from the home site should be relevant to the entire organization

<br/>

**Considerations:**
- Align the branding on the home site to the overall intranet brand where possible
- For organizations with many portals and resources, consider making your home site a hub site to expand navigational options and easily sync permissions and branding across many sites
- If the site you want to be your home site isn't currently your root site and you want it to be, first replace your root site with the site, and then make the site your home site
- Use a home site template from the SharePoint look book called The Landing to jump-start the design process

| Norms typically determined by the team. Practices are aligned in the best way to get work done.  | Policies often determined by the organization to ensure consistency of experience and effective management of organizational information.  | Governance determined by each owner of the associated site based on the type of site and organizational policies. The best experience for visitors is achieved when everyone has at least read permissions for associated sites (but this is not required). |
| Created by **Site owner** (unless this has been disabled in your organization) or admin. | Created by **Site owner** (unless this has been disabled in your organization) | Created by **Global admin** or **SharePoint admin** in Microsoft 365 |

## Root Site


The root site is automatically provisioned by Microsoft online services and exists at the top of your SharePoint URL domain `https://[orgdomain].sharepoint.com`.

Before April 2019, the root site was a classic team site, in a new Microsoft 365 tenant, the root site is a modern communication site.

There is one rule, you must never delete the root since it’s the “root site”. All other team site or communication on the environment will exist within this domain, for example:
 - `https://[yourdomain].sharepoint.com/sites/[SiteUrl]`
 - `https://[yourdomain].sharepoint.com/teams/[SiteUrl]`


SharePoint administrators can replace the root site with another modern site using SharePoint admin center.
