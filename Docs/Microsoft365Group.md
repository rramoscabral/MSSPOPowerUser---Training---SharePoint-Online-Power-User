- [Excel](https://www.microsoft.com/en-ww/microsoft-365/excel)
- [OneNote](https://www.microsoft.com/en-ww/microsoft-365/onenote/digital-note-taking-app)

- [Word](https://www.microsoft.com/en-ww/microsoft-365/word)
- [Yammer](https://www.microsoft.com/en-ww/microsoft-365/yammer/yammer-overview)


The user associated with this type of group can collaborate with the other users of the group in an easy way and easily set resources such as a shared Outlook inbox, shared calendar or a document library for collaborating on files.


### Privacy

The group has its own privacy which can be public or private
- **Public groups** can be joined by everyone without getting approval from a group owner. Anyone can access the group content.
- **Private groups** aren't open for everyone to join them and group owners are the ones that can add members to them. Only members can access the group content.

Neither public groups nor private groups can be seen or accessed by people outside of your organization unless those people have been specifically invited as guests.


### Group email

Microsoft 365 groups allow teams to collaborate by giving them a group email and a shared workspace for conversations, files, and calendars.


### Microsoft Teams

Microsoft Teams supports collaboration through chat, calls, and online meetings. The teams you add are collections of people, content, and tools. Groups are a collection of people, and are useful if you only need a group email address. It can take up to an hour for new distribution groups and mail-enabled security groups to appear here.

In Teams you can create a group from an existing 365 group or from something you already own.

## Who can create Microsoft 365 Groups

By default, all users can create Microsoft 365 groups. This is the recommended approach because it allows users to start collaborating without requiring assistance from IT.

But organizations can restrict access to create groups.
